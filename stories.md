Story #1 (Participant A, C, Q4)
When I navigate the app,
I want to be able to use the keyboard ,
So I don't have to use the mouse,
Because I prefer not to and find using the keyboard easier.


Story #2 (Participant A, Q5)
When I look at the app,
I want there to be good contrast in text and background colours,
So it is easier to read,
Because low contrast makes it harder to read, especially in bright light.


Story #3
When I am searching through tasks
I want to be able to filter through the tasks
So I can find a specfic task 
because I want to be able to find it faster


Story #4
When I am on the app,
I want the app to have a good layout,
So I can easily naviagate,
Because I can work faster, and makes it easier to use


Story #5
When I have created a task
I want to be able to edit the task
So I can adjust the task
Because the information may change and I want to the task to reflect that.
